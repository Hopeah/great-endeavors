## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Solving a kata has been a part of my morning routine since the beginning of spring 2022, it gets my brain working and serves as a perfect way to start the day!

## Optimizations

Whenever there is time, I like to go over some of the challenges and try to refactor using new techniques and methods I have learned.

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest lesson I am continuously taught by doing these is patience. When I first started, I always tried to solve the katas immediately, which often turned into frustration. Now, I give myself at least 5 minutes to actually think on what is given and what needs to be done, which helps me to fully wrap my head around the problem and leads to solutions.
