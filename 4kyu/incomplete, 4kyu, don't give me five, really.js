// This kata is the performance version of Don't give me five by user5036852.

// Your mission, should you accept it, is to return the count of all integers in a given range which do not contain the digit 5 (in base 10 representation).
// You are given the start and the end of the integer range. The start and the end are both inclusive.

// The result may contain fives. ;-)
// The start will always be smaller than the end. Both numbers can be also negative.

// The regions can be very large and there will be a large number of test cases. So brute force solutions will certainly time out!

// Good luck, warrior!

//PREP

//P - parameters 
//Given two integers, either could be negative, that specify a region (inclusive) of numbers

//R - returns
//Return the amount of numbers in the specified region that do not contain any "5" in them

//E - examples
// 1,9 -> 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -> return 8
// 4,17 -> 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -> return 12

//P - pseudocode
